The one big thing I found with my research is that I am greatly under qualified for most jobs listed for IT major graduates. There are so many languages that are out there that I never knew existed and, thus, not idea how they work or what they do. So, for me, my first step is getting more acclimated to these other coding languages. Currently, I only know a little Java and even smaller C. I’m starting to realize that if I’m ever going to get a job, a real computer science job, then I’ve got to expand my knowledge of code.

Another thing I realized I need to do to get more qualified is become more technologically aware of the advancements in the US. While I was searching, there were a lot of companies that I didn’t choose because I didn’t know who they were and what kind of technology they worked with.

That being said, a way to make myself more marketable and qualified (along with learning more coding languages) is by becoming more familiar with different types of technology. I would say that I am pretty rooted on Android phones and Windows computers. However, if I want to be a mobile application developer or a website builder, it is  imperative that I create code that can function on all systems. Granted, there are mobile applications that only work on one type of phone; but, I find that limiting to not only the public but the developer. To me, being able to flow between different languages, different hardware, effortlessly is a big way to become more qualified than other people trying to apply for the job.

The big question to ask myself is the following: how? Everything I've previously mentioned will get me more qualified and are definitely great milestone markers. But, if I cannot create an action step plan than all of this is for loss. So, over this semester, I plan on going online to look up different languages that I can teach myself over the summer along with watching videos on different hardware, such as Macs, iPhones, Androids, HPs, etc. and doing my best to, in some way, have contact with mentioned hardware to actually play around with the interfaces.
